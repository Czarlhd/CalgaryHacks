INSPIRATION:
It is annoying and tedious having to find class messenger group chats at the start of every semester,
it sometimes results in the creation of multiple group chats for the same class. Although there are
alternative solutions, students often still prefer to use Facebook messenger. Since Facebook disabled 
the function where people can join a chat via a link, now, hundreds of students can only be added to
the chat one by one through an invitation of a current group member. All of these issues may lead to
miscommunication and stress, and that’s why we came up with McUnity!

WHAT IT DOES:
At the beginning of each semester, McUnity will create a Facebook messenger group chat for each registered
class. When a student creates a McUnity account using their school email and Facebook account, they will be
able to add a list of their courses for that semester under their name. Then, our app will take the student’s
username and other Facebook information, add them into the pre-created Facebook chats for those specific classes.

By clicking on the courses on their profile page, our app will automatically take them to the Facebook messenger
group for that class, and it’s time for them to say hi to their classmates! By the end of the semester, these group
chats will be automatically deleted to reduce the clutter in the users’ list of conversations.

A student can also connect with their peers by using the search function. Based on criteria such as majors, interests,
and classes, McUnity will suggest a list of users, whose profiles can then be consulted.


WHAT'S NEXT FOR MCUNITY:
We hope to be able to connect our functionalities with Facebook and the McGill student database.
This will allow us to have a fully functional product.
